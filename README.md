# ⚙️ High Velocity Impact Welding (HVIW) Techniques for Dissimilar Materials

A comprehensive review and analysis of **solid-state welding techniques** where high-velocity impacts enable bonding without melting, particularly for **dissimilar materials**.  
The study focuses on **Explosive Welding (EXW)**, **Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW)**, and **Laser Impact Welding (LIW)**.


---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the **mechanism of interface formation** in HVIW.  
- Compare parameters (impact velocity, stand-off distance, collision angle).  
- Evaluate **bond strength and industrial feasibility** for dissimilar materials.  

---

## 🧠 Overview
HVIW processes use **kinetic energy** instead of thermal energy.  
When two plates collide at several hundred m/s, **plastic flow and jet formation** at the interface cause **metallurgical bonding** without melting.
