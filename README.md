# ‚öôÔ∏è High Velocity Impact Welding (HVIW) Techniques for Dissimilar Materials

A comprehensive review and analysis of **solid-state welding techniques** where high-velocity impacts enable bonding without melting, particularly for **dissimilar materials**.  
The study focuses on **Explosive Welding (EXW)**, **Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW)**, and **Laser Impact Welding (LIW)**.

## üîπ **1. What is High-Velocity Impact Welding?**

*Definition:*
High-Velocity Impact Welding (**HVIW**) is a solid-state welding process where two metal surfaces collide at very high speed and pressure‚Äîforming a strong atomic bond without melting the materials.

*Key idea:*
- The impact generates a metallic jet that removes oxides and contaminants.
- The clean surfaces come close enough (atomic distance) to bond.
- Happens within microseconds and at room temperature.

*Why it‚Äôs used:*
- Joins dissimilar metals (e.g., Al‚ÄìFe, Ti‚ÄìCu) that are difficult to weld by fusion processes.
- Avoids defects like cracks, porosity, and distortion.

---

## üîπ **2. Basic Mechanism of HVIW**

- A flyer plate (thin metal) is accelerated at high velocity toward a target plate.
- The plates collide at an angle (impact angle Œ≤).
- The impact creates a jet of material from both surfaces.
- This jet cleans the surfaces by removing oxides and contaminants.
- Under high pressure, atoms of the two clean metals come close enough to form a metallic bond.

| **Parameter**                             | **Meaning**                         | **Effect**                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Impact velocity (V)**               | Speed of flyer during collision | Determines if bonding occurs                          |
| **Impact angle (Œ≤)**                  | Angle between flyer & target    | Controls jet formation                                |
| **Impact pressure (P)**               | Pressure at collision           | Must be high enough for deformation but below melting |
| **Flyer thickness (t)**               | Controls energy transfer        | Too thick = low speed; too thin = deformation         |
| **Standoff distance (L)**             | Gap before collision            | Controls angle and velocity                           |

## üß© Jet Phenomenon:

- The jet is a thin, fast stream of metal ejected from the collision zone.
- It‚Äôs critical for welding because it cleans the interface.
- The jet forms only if:
  - Impact angle is not 0¬∞ (needs oblique collision)
  - Pressure is high enough
  - Velocity is within suitable range (typically 200‚Äì900 m/s)
